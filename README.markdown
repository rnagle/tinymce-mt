# TinyMCE -- Rich Text Editor for MovableType
- [Original plugin](http://plugins.movabletype.org/tinymce/) by Alfasado, Inc.
- Modifications by Ryan Nagle
- Last updated: July 13, 2010

## Requires:

- [Configuration Assistant](http://github.com/byrnereese/mt-plugin-configassistant) version 1.7.1 or newer
- Movable Type 4.261 or newer*
    
    \*This is the only version of MT that I've tested with -- not sure how nicely it plays with others.

## Installation:

1. Copy the contents of the TinyMCE directory to your /mt/ directory. 

    If you need/want a more in-depth run-down, visit Byrne Reese's guide to installing MT plugins: [http://bit.ly/c1YGMw](http://bit.ly/c1YGMw)

## Usage Notes:

This plugin allows bloggers the option of using TinyMCE as their Rich Text Editor. Change by navigating to Preferences > Rich Text Editor.

It's possible that this plugin can be extended to offer other RTE options. If you're interested in doing that, you can start by checking my comments in Plugin.pm.
